## Why homelab? 

There's plenty of reasons to run a homelab, and just as many pros and cons of doing so. Above all however, the answer is easy: to learn! Whether you're an IT professional, amateur, or person who just really likes computer, homelabs are the perfect platform to experiment in. It's your own sandbox enviroment where if you break it, you fix it, you learn something, and hopefully don't upset too many people while it's down!
