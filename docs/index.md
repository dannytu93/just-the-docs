# Getting Started

Human memory sucks. Chances are there's been times you've gone back and looked at stuff you did a few hours or days before, let alone years, and asked yourself what you were thinking or why you did certain things. Let's fix that!

Not only do I love to self-host, but I also love being able to remember all of the fixes and random tweaks that I had to do to deploy any service. If you're like me, you're constantly testing new apps or services. Having a central location to store tips, tricks, and general processes of past installs should be well documented.

Hence - this wiki!

This aims to provide a repository for all of my services that hopefully will be of use to myself and those reading as well.

# General Information

Okay, so if I love self-hosting so much, why is this on GitHub? No self-hosted wikis like Bookstack, DokuWiki, or Wiki.js? Simple, accessibility.

If my server decides to explode or the neighborhood internet goes down, I can't access my documentation when I need it the most. Yes, having multiple backups are important. Yes, I could use a VPS for improved uptime. But being able to access this information without jumping through additional hoops is a win for me. This also forces me to improve my own documentation and writing rather than saving a bunch of random commands with one line explanations of what they do! Extra points for being able to style with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)!

So, without further ado, here's my current stack:

# Proxmox

# Docker

# OPNsense

# TrueNAS
